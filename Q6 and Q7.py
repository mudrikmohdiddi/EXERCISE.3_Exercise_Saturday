# 6. (Table) Using the techniques of this chapter, write a program that calculates the squares and
#  cubes of the integers from 0 to 10. Use tabs to print the following neatly formatted table of value
n=0
print("integer ","squares ","cubes   ")
while(n<4):
    sn=n
    sq=sn**2
    cb=sn**3
    n=n+1
    print(sn,"       ",sq,"       ",cb,)
while(n<10):
    sn=n
    sq=sn**2
    cb=sn**3
    n=n+1
    print(sn,"       ",sq,"      ",cb,)
while(n<11):
    sn=n
    sq=sn**2
    cb=sn**3
    n=n+1
    print(sn,"      ",sq,"     ",cb,)
